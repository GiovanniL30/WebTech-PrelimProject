              </a>
              <p>April 18, 2024</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="latest-new-text">
            <p>
              Known for its vast waters and beaches, the Philippines is one of
              the world’s richest countries in marine biodiversity and has been
              deemed an ideal utopia for divers and environmentalists. However,
              due to pollution, overfishing, and climate change, the country’s
              marine ecosystem is at risk of being destroyed, posing a threat
              not just to the country’s resources but also to the environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Philippines’ latest Ocean Health Index (OCI) ranks 214 out of
              220 nations with an overall score of 58 over 100, which is below
              the global average of 73, giving them a grim reminder of the
              deteriorating health of their marine ecosystem.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The OHI index measures how well a nation’s marine systems can
              benefit and provide service to its citizens sustainably. The
              overall score is measured through 10 “goal” scores which are Food
              provision, Artisanal fishing opportunities, Natural products,
              Carbon storage, Coastal protection, Livelihood and economies,
              Tourism and recreation, Senso of place, clean waters, and
              Biodiversity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though the Philippines scored a below-average score, they
              showed their strengths in some goal scores, which are Coastal
              Protection and Artisanal Fishing Opportunities. The one aspect
              they need to improve on is their weak sustainable tourism
              performance. OHI stated that because of the Philippines'
              unattractive conditions, tourism is declining. In response, the
              Department of Tourism (DOT) vowed to focus on this problem and
              continue pursuing a sustainable future in Philippine tourism.

                      SDG 14 goals to hold and sustainably use oceans and marine
                      resources by marine pollution, ocean acidification, and
                      overfishing. The oceans are key for controlling the
                      climate, providing food and oxygen, and supporting
                      livelihoods, but they are threatened by pollution,
                      warming, and acidification, which negatively impact marine
                      ecosystems and biodiversity. These changes can greatly
                      affect biodiversity. It will take immediate international
                      action to stop the harm and save marine life for
                      generations.

                      In May 2022, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
                      presented how nuclear science and technology can
                      contribute to tackling plastic pollution and reducing
                      atmospheric carbon dioxide at the UN Ocean Conference in
                      Lisbon, Portugal. The IAEA showcased its efforts in
                      applying nuclear techniques to monitor plastic movement in
                      the ocean and create new materials capable for removing
                      microplastics from water. Additionally, the agency
                      discussed its research into utilizing nuclear energy for
                      carbon capture and storage technologies, which can either
                      store C02 underground or transform it into valuable
                      products.

                      nutritious seafood

                    <p>
                      Researchers have created a sustainable aquaculture system
                      to cultivate “Naked Clams”, a fast-growing, nutritious
                      bivalve that can grow up to 30 cm within six months by
                      digging into waste wood. These clams are high in Vitamin
                      B12 and can be enriched with omega-3 fatty acids, making
                      them a promising low-impact alternative protein source. In
                      the Spring of 2022, UN Women visited Seychelles to
                      emphasize the vital role women play in marine conservation
                      and sustainable ocean practices. The initiative
                      underscored the importance of empowering women in the
                      fisheries industry, where they frequently encounter
                      obstacles like low wages and restricted decision-making
                      authority. By boosting women’s representation and access
                      to resources, UN Women aims to strengthen their impact on
                      sustainable ocean management.
