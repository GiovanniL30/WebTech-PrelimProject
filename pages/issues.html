                <h1>Dynamite Fishing</h1>
                <p>
                  Dynamite Fishing or Blast fishing is when a fisherman uses
                  dynamite or any form of explosives to stun or kill fish. This
                  fishing method is widely practiced in many countries and
                  regions across the globe. Dynamite fishing greatly damages
                  marine ecosystems by destroying coral reefs and can kill
                  different types of fishes within the blast radius.

                  The United Nations has developed a new way of locating and
                  stopping fishermen who use dynamite fishing through the use of
                  technology that locates explosions in the ocean. Fishermen are
                  discouraged to use dynamite fishing and report dynamite
                  fishing activities to the proper authorities.

                <h1>Cyanide Fishing</h1>
                <p>
                  Cyanide fishing was first used in the Philippines in the 1960s
                  to supply the international aquarium trade. Cyanide Fishing is
                  performed by crushing and dissolving Sodium Cyanide into
                  squirt bottles and then spraying it onto fishes which stuns
                  them and allows the fishermen to scoop them up. This damages
                  and kills coral reefs where fish often live and breed in.

                  Taking legal actions on fishermen who still use cyanide
                  fishing by reporting them to the proper authorities. To stop
                  the importation of fish products that are a result of cyanide
                  fishing could help in preventing the further use of this
                  method altogether.

                <p>
                  The Philippines is one of the world’s top contributors to
                  marine plastic pollution, with 0.28 to 0.75 million tonnes of
                  plastic entering the oceans and coastal areas per year.

                  The Philippines aims to promote over 60% recovery and
                  recycling of plastic by 2030. They also plan to create
                  recycling facilities within Metro Manila to help lessen
                  plastic pollution.

                <p>
                  Overfishing in the Philippines has been a problem due to the
                  fact that over 75% of the nation’s fishing ground has been
                  depleted. This threatens the nation’s food source and the
                  livelihoods of many within the Philippines.

                  to allow fishes to breed and multiply. A movement called Fish
                  Forever also aims to help fishermen manage and regulate
                  fishing within Philippine waters.
